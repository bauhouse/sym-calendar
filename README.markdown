#### Adding Navigation Group to sections

Be sure to run the following MySQL commands to get the new section navigation group functionality. Change `sym_` to match your table prefix value

	ALTER TABLE  `sym_sections` ADD  `navigation_group` VARCHAR( 50 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT  'Content';
	
	ALTER TABLE  `sym_sections` ADD INDEX (  `navigation_group` ) ;

#### Update Upload Field

Update your corresponding entries_data_xx table with the following:

	ALTER TABLE `tbl_entries_data_XX` CHANGE `mimetype` `mimetype` VARCHAR( 50 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL

The table number, 'XX' should be whatever ID of your upload field. If you have more than one upload field, run the above query for each field.
