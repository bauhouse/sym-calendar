Export Ensemble
------------------------------------

Version: 1.0
Author: Alistair Kearney (alistair@symphony21.com)
Build Date: 7th Dec 2008
Requirements: Latest Symphony 2 build, ZIP enabled (--enable-zip)

This is a replacement for the Symphony 2 Beta "Create Ensemble" feature, cut from the final Symphony 2 release.

It uses the ZIP module of PHP, and as such is memory efficient and should allow for much larger sites to be exported without the need for increasing PHP's memory limit.

Currently this extension adds a "Create" button to the preferences page. In the future it will instead have its own interface with options for including additional files and folders as well as excluding and other options.


[INSTALLATION]

** Note: The latest version can alway be grabbed with "git clone git://github.com/pointybeard/export_ensemble.git"

1. Upload the 'export_ensemble' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Export Ensemble", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
