[INSTALLING FROM GIT]

1. Clone the git repository to the location you desire using:

	git clone git://github.com/symphony/symphony-2.git
		
	Should you wish to make contributions back to the project, feel free to fork the
	master tree, instead of cloning, and issue pull requests via github.

2. Grab the Maintenance Mode, Select Box Link Field, Export Ensemble and Markdown Extensions

	git clone git://github.com/pointybeard/maintenance_mode.git
	git clone git://github.com/pointybeard/selectbox_link_field.git
	git clone git://github.com/pointybeard/export_ensemble.git
	git clone git://github.com/pointybeard/markdown.git
	
	Each of these need to be placed in the /extensions folder

3. Follow from step 2 below



[INSTALLATION]

** See further down for updating instructions **

1. This step assumes you downloaded a zip archive from the Symphony website 
   (http://symphony21.com). Upload the following files and 
   directories to the root directory of your website:

     - index.php
     - install.php
     - /symphony
     - /workspace
     - /extensions

   (Alternatively, you can upload the .zip archive to the same location and
   run 'unzip' from the command line.)
	
   Note: You can leave /workspace out if you do not want the default theme.

2. Point your web browser at http://yourwebsite.com/install.php and provide
   details for establishing a database connection and about your server
   environment.

3. Celebrate!
